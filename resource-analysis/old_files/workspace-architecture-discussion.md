# Workspace Architecture Discussion - Key Points

## Current Architecture Decision: Workspace = Project/Autorizatie de construire

### Why This Approach Works Well
- **Complete company separation** - Essential for SaaS scaling
- **Natural business boundary** - Each project has distinct stakeholders, contracts, budgets
- **Security & Data isolation** - Banking/financial data stays project-specific
- **Real construction industry alignment** - Matches how companies organize work around building permits

### Workspace Structure (Final Model)
```
Workspace (Project/Autorizatie de construire)
├── Beneficiary Company (client who owns/funds the project)
├── BuildingPermit (separate model with permit details)
├── Multiple Executor Companies (contractors/subcontractors doing work)
├── Multiple Users (from both beneficiary and executor companies)
└── All project entities (contracts, work reports, construction sites, etc.)
```

### Key Insights from Real-World Experience

#### Company Role Flexibility
- Same company can be both **executor** and **beneficiary** in the same workspace
- Example: Architecture firm executes work for client AND subcontracts to specialists
- This dual-role scenario is common in construction industry

#### General Contractor Flag
- Add `general_contractor = true/false` attribute to company relationships
- General contractors manage whole projects and can subcontract
- Different permissions/responsibilities than regular subcontractors

### Scale Context
- Target: Large projects with 12-15 buildings across 10 projects
- Geographic distribution: ~5 sites across country
- Each workspace = one building permit/project
- Multiple workspaces per construction company is expected and beneficial

### BuildingPermit Model Decision
**Create separate model** (not workspace attributes):
- Better data integrity and normalization
- Future flexibility for multiple permits per workspace
- Proper relationship modeling with other entities
- Separate querying and auditing capabilities

### Benefits for SaaS Scaling
- Each construction company gets multiple project workspaces
- Natural pricing model (per project/workspace)
- Built-in data isolation between companies
- Easy backup/migration per project
- Users invited to specific project workspaces based on involvement

### Action Items for Implementation
1. Confirm BuildingPermit as separate model linked to workspace
2. Implement company role flexibility (executor + beneficiary simultaneously)
3. Add general_contractor flag to company-workspace relationships
4. Ensure user permissions work across workspace roles
5. Test multi-role scenarios in development environment

### Real-World Validation
This architecture was validated against actual construction industry experience:
- Based on architect's experience with multi-company project dynamics
- Accounts for complex contractor/subcontractor relationships
- Matches how building permits and projects are organized in practice
- Handles the reality of companies wearing multiple "hats" in same project

### Next Steps
Review this analysis and create detailed implementation plan focusing on:
- Company role flexibility implementation
- BuildingPermit model design
- User permission matrix across different company roles
- Testing scenarios for complex multi-role relationships
